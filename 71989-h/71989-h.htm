THIS monograph forms the second
number of a series which opened
with the pamphlet on the Tuscan
Stradivari, published nearly two years
ago, when that remarkable violin was in our
possession.</p>

<p class='c012'>Our purpose in these publications is to furnish
descriptive notices of some of the masterpieces
of violin making, with critical analyses of their
characteristic features and authentic particulars of
their history. In pursuance of this object we have
spared no pains in seeking original sources of
information, and in carefully sifting evidence; and,
by these means, we hope to succeed in correcting
many of the loose ideas current with regard to the
works of Stradivari and the other great makers, and
in establishing trustworthy data for the guidance
of the present and future generations of devotees of
the violin.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>In the preparation of the materials for the present
memoir, we have been greatly indebted to our friend
Signor Federico Sacchi, of Cremona, for his indefatigable
researches at the fountain-head of information
on the subject of Stradivari and his native town; and
we desire to take this opportunity of acknowledging the
great value of his assistance in throwing light upon
many points previously obscure.</p>

<p class='c012'>Our observations upon the general characteristics of
the instrument, and the comparative analysis of its
distinctive features, are based upon a professional
experience of more than fifty years, engrafted upon
family traditions in the craft dating from the
middle of the last century. Our own views are supplemented
by the published testimony of several authorities
whose opinions cannot fail to command respect
wherever the name of Stradivari is known.</p>

<p class='c012'>Finally we would express our obligations to Mr.
Robert Harrison for the time and thought which he
has devoted to the collation of materials for the memoir,
and to his congenial task of editing the whole work.</p>

THE Exhibition of Ancient Musical Instruments,
held at the South Kensington
Museum in 1872, comprised a Collection
of Violins such as had never before
been brought together, and afforded
to the musical amateur an unprecedented opportunity
of studying the beauties of some of the
most precious instruments in Europe. Of these,
perhaps none excited so much interest among connoisseurs
as a Violin by Stradivari, lent by M<sup>sr</sup>.
Vuillaume, the celebrated Parisian maker and
dealer, and thus described by him in the official
Catalogue of the Exhibition.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c018'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c019'>“Cet instrument a été à peine joué. Il fut acheté
vers 1760 par le Comte Cozio de Salabue, grand
seigneur et dilettante, qui l’a toujours respecté et
conservé jusqu’à sa mort. Ses héritiers l’ont vendu
à Luigi Tarisio, connoisseur et fanatique d’instruments,
qui l’a conservé sans le laisser voir à personne jusqu’à
1854. A l’epoque de sa mort il était recommendé à ses
héritiers, et caché soigneusement dans la Ferme de la
Croix, à côté du Village de Fontaneto, près de
Novara (Italie). C’est là que son propriétaire actuel
est allé le chercher dans le mois de Janvier, 1855. Le
bois dont il est fait est rémarquable par la richesse de
ses ondes. La perfection du travail, la beauté du
vernis, rien ne lui manque. C’est un violon qui semble
sortir de la main du maître. C’est enfin le seul,
l’unique instrument de Stradivarius, qui soit parvenu
jusqu’à nous, en cet état de parfaite conservation;
or, ce monument intact de l’ancienne lutherie, cet
instrument que l’archet n’à pas fait resonner dans
l’espace de plus d’un siècle et demi, qui s’est ecoulé
depuis l’epoque de sa fabrication, cet instrument vient
donner un éclatant dementi à cette opinion d’après
laquelle le son ne pourrait se produire libre et pur
qu’après un long usage, parcequ’ici dans un instrument
neuf on trouve toutes les qualités réunies—force,
moelleux, rondeur, finesse, vibration facile, ton distingué,
noble, incisif.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>Lent by M. VUILLAUME, <span class='sc'>Paris</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>The title at the head of the enthusiastic description
above quoted sufficed in itself to excite the great
interest exhibited by the musical public in this
celebrated instrument. They saw for the first time
a violin, long known to them by repute, which, partly
by design and partly by accident, had been surrounded
with a certain halo of romantic mystery, ever since
its existence had first been asserted, and long before
the instrument itself had been actually inspected
by any of the recognised experts of England or
France. As will be seen later, the title was conferred
upon it in connection with its long deferred
production to the musical world.</p>

<p class='c012'>The extraordinary industry of the great master
Antonio Stradivari is well known. Notwithstanding
the minute care and precision which characterised his
work, he may safely be credited with the construction of
not less than two thousand instruments during his long
and active life. We have evidence that he remained at
his bench to the very end of his days, for in a document
to which further reference is made below we find
mention of a perfect instrument bearing date 1736,
with his age, inscribed with his own hand upon the
label as ninety-two.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c018'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>The instruments made by Stradivari were for the
most part distributed throughout the Courts and noble
houses of Europe. We have records of several
concertos of instruments made by him upon the
commission of the Courts of Spain, Modena, Tuscany,
Poland, and others, from the time when he began to
acquire a European reputation. Among these was the
great concerto presented by the Cremonese Nobleman,
the Marchese Bartolommeo Ariberti, to the Court of
Tuscany, and containing that marvellous instrument
which, after being long hidden from the world, came to
light in recent times and excited so much admiration
two years ago, when it was first exhibited in this
country. There were, however, undoubtedly many
fine specimens of his work remaining in their maker’s
hands at the time of his death, and these passed into
the possession of his family. Fortunately, from a
manuscript which remained in the possession of an
enthusiastic Cremonese chronicler, Vincenzo Lancetti,
we learn the fate of some of the instruments inherited
by the great maker’s sons. Lancetti was an active
man of letters, and the author of important biographical
works, including “Cremonese Worthies,” “A Dictionary
of Pseudonyms,” “A Dictionary of the Poets Laureate
of every Nation,” and numerous other books, published
between 1796 and 1830, when he was in Milan as
Director of the Archives of the War Office. In
1823, having in contemplation a biographical memoir
of the violin makers of his native town, he enlisted the
assistance of the wealthy amateur and great connoisseur,
Count Alessandro Cozio di Salabue, of Casale
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Monferrato (Piedmont.) The work unhappily was
never completed, but Count Salabue’s original sketch
for the memoir (in the hand of his amanuensis,
here partly reproduced in fac-simile) affords us some
valuable information on the subject. From this memorandum,
dated “Milan, January, 1823,” we learn that,
in addition to the large number of Stradivari’s violins
scattered throughout Europe, ninety-one were in his
possession at the time of his death. In 1775 ten
of these instruments were still in the hands of his
son Paolo, the youngest child of his second marriage,
who sold them in that year, together with two choice
instruments by Francesco Stradivari (the second
son), and all the forms, models, and tools left by
their father, to the Count Salabue, whose collection
has become so famous in the annals of the Cremona
School.</p>

<p class='c012'>The name of this amateur must ever be held in
grateful remembrance for his loving care of the
Italian masterpieces. It is to such men that we owe
the preservation of nearly all the finest existing instruments
of the 17th and 18th centuries. Endowed with
great wealth and rare judgment, he formed an unrivalled
representative collection of the works of
the great masters of the craft, and by his careful
researches amassed an amount of information which
might well have served as an invaluable tradition
of an apparently vanishing art. To such a man
the acquisition of ten undoubted specimens of the
incomparable Stradivari must have been one of the
greatest events of his life.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>The Count’s memorandum informs us that his
purchase included two masterpieces of the great maker;
one of large size, with a label bearing date 1716, and
another of medium size, dated 1736, and bearing on
the label the inscription “d’anni 92,” in Stradivari’s
own hand; both quite new and untouched, and rare
models for a good maker. The former instrument,
with which we are now concerned, is described in
the memorandum as of exquisite workmanship, and
perfect quality of wood, with a tone of great evenness
and power.</p>

<p class='c012'>This remarkable violin, received at first hand from
the very workshop of its great maker, remained
carefully preserved in the Count Salabue’s collection
at Milan, until after his death. It is a noteworthy
instance of the fascination exercised by a perfect violin,
that no one of the successive owners of this splendid
instrument, from Stradivari himself downwards, would
part with it until called away by death. After the
death of the Count, his heirs in 1827 sold the Stradivari
of 1716 to a man whose career merits a passing
notice, on account of the important part he played
in rescuing innumerable works of the greatest violin
makers from obscurity and, perhaps, destruction.</p>

    <div>TRANSLATION.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>“So large was the number of (instruments and) especially
violins, made by Stradivari that, in addition to those distributed
over the whole of Europe, ninety-one were left by
him at his death. In 1775 ten of these still remained in the
hands of his son, Paolo, and were then bought, together with
two masterpieces of his other son, Francesco, by Count
Cozio. In the collection of the Count Cozio—so often cited—are
two of the greatest masterpieces of the most famous
Antonio Stradivari. The one, of larger size—of most
beautiful workmanship and wood—of perfect quality—having
a very powerful and even tone—bears on the label the date
1716. The other has on the label the date 1736, and,
written below by Stradivari himself, the inscription “92
years old.” This violin, though of medium size, nearly
equals the earlier instrument in perfection and power of tone.
Both are quite new and intact and well suited to serve as
choice models for a good instrument maker.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Luigi Tarisio was a man of humble birth, and
followed the calling of a carpenter in the small village
of Fontaneto, near Novara, in Piedmont, where also
the celebrated Viotti was born. Taking up fiddle
playing as an amusement, Tarisio was led by degrees
to devote his attention to the subtle beauties of the
great instruments of his country, the pursuit of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>became the absorbing passion of his life. So strong
was its influence that he left his trade and home to
wander about the country in search of violins. The
experience thus acquired soon taught him to appreciate
the merits of the great creations of Brescia, Cremona,
and the other homes of violin making in Italy, and
the commercial instinct, which formed so marked an
element of his character, convinced him that the
increasing demand for these instruments might be
turned to profitable account.</p>

<p class='c012'>It must be remembered that in those days the works
of the leading Italian makers had in great part remained
in their native country, and in their original condition;
but they were not, as is popularly supposed, to be found
in the hands of peasants in out-of-the-way villages.</p>

<p class='c012'>Tarisio could hardly fail to become aware of the
treasures amassed by Count Cozio di Salabue, whose
estate was near to his own native province, and he
availed himself of the opportunity afforded by the death
of that great enthusiast, and the partial dispersion of his
collections, to gain possession of some of the gems,
which he had probably long coveted. How much
of the Count’s collection came into the hands of
Tarisio is not recorded, but evidence is forthcoming
that the perfect Stradivari of 1716 became the property
of the humble Italian carpenter in 1827. When
he had accumulated a stock of instruments which
he believed would command a market in any of
the European capitals, he determined to try his
fortunes in Paris. He reached that city for the first
time in 1827, travelling, it is said, on foot, in order
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>to save his purse. Although furnished in the first
instance with the less rare specimens of his collection
he soon found a ready demand for the goods
of which he had then almost a monopoly, and,
encouraged by the leading dealers of Paris, he soon
established a regular trade with that city, making
periodical visits thither, separated by intervals which
he devoted to collecting in his own country; and,
on each occasion, astounding his foreign friends
by some fresh evidence of his judgment and good
fortune in securing the masterpieces of Cremona and
Brescia. Early in the course of his relations with
the Parisian dealers, he began to talk of the wonderful
Stradivari which he had obtained from the Salabue
collection; but he was careful never to bring it with
him to France, relying on reiteration of its wondrous
qualities to create a sufficiently acute curiosity among
his customers. So long was this mystery maintained
that Tarisio and his Salabue became a byeword among
the dealers of Paris, and gave rise to the name by which
the violin has ever since been known. On one occasion
Tarisio was enlarging upon his favourite theme to
Vuillaume, when Alard, the violinist, who was present,
exclaimed: “Ah ça, votre violon est donc comme le
Messie; on l’attend toujours, et il ne parait jamais.”
The violin, as Vidal says, “was baptised!” Tarisio,
however, could never be persuaded to produce “le
Messie,” and at his death, in October, 1854, the world
had still only the tradition of its excellence. The
celebrated author, Mr. Charles Reade, who was himself
a great enthusiast and no mean connoisseur, and in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>earlier days an importer of Italian instruments, refers,
in some notes on this violin, to Tarisio’s reluctance to
produce it.</p>

<p class='c012'>The man’s death was in keeping with his life. The
possessor of priceless specimens of the instruments he
loved, he lived in penury, and was found dead in his
garret in Milan, surrounded by fiddles, large, small,
perfect, and imperfect, piled up on the floor in cases,
hung upon the walls, and even from the rafters of the
miserable attic that he made his home.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c018'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>Many characteristic anecdotes are related of this
strange man which cannot find a place in our brief
notice, and for which the curious reader is referred to
the notes of Mr. Charles Reade, given in “Readiana,”
and to other works.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Reade says of him, writing from personal knowledge,
“The man’s whole soul was in fiddles. He was
a great dealer, but a greater amateur, for he had gems
by him no money would buy from him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Relatives were soon found to claim the effects of the
deceased collector; and three months afterwards the
news of his death reached Paris, where it created no
small flutter among the dealers and amateurs, who were
well aware that the shabby Italian must have left
a magnificent collection of instruments. The most
eminent of all that Paris community, J. B. Vuillaume,
lost no time in placing himself in communication with
Tarisio’s heirs, with a view to the acquisition of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>treasures, and started for Italy on the 8th January,
1855. There, at the small farm De la Croix, near
Fontaneto, which had belonged to Tarisio, he found the
relatives assembled with every appearance of the most
sordid poverty. His first question was, “Where are
the instruments?” “At Milan,” was the answer; “but
six violins are here,” and there in a corner of the room
were six cases. Vuillaume was not slow to inspect
their contents, kneeling upon the floor, on which they
were piled in default of furniture, and one after the
other he drew forth five splendid instruments—first a
magnificent Stradivari, then a beautiful Giuseppe Guarnieri;
next a Carlo Bergonzi, in perfect preservation,
and two almost untouched Guadagnini, and lastly the
gem of the collection, the long talked of “new”
Stradivari of 1716—Le Messie. Vuillaume’s experienced
eye at once recognised the justification of all
Tarisio’s raptures over this instrument, and, determined
by what he had already seen, he entered into negotiations
which resulted in the purchase of the whole of
the collection. The purchase was completed at a
price which has been stated at £3,166, an amount
which Vuillaume probably more than realised without
parting with the most precious treasure of them
all. This he kept as the apple of his eye for twenty
years, and before pursuing its fortunes farther, we
may glance in passing at the life of the man who is
entitled to share with Count Cozio di Salabue, and
Tarisio, the chief credit of having rescued and preserved
one of the greatest masterpieces that have
issued from Cremona.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Jean Baptiste Vuillaume was born in 1798 at
Mirecourt, where his father and grandfather before him
had followed the calling of violin makers, and where he
served his apprenticeship to the craft. At nineteen
years of age he made his way to Paris, where
he obtained an engagement as workman with
the elder Chanot (Francis), with whom he remained
until 1821, when he entered the service of an
organ builder named Lété, who also dealt in violins,
and with whom he was taken into partnership in 1825.
In 1828, happily married, and fortified with considerable
experience, grafted on a strong natural intelligence,
he launched himself on a career which made his name
famous in the annals of violin making. Sprung from
an industrious and thrifty working class, he had lost
no opportunity of perfecting his knowledge of the
instrument to which he devoted his talents and the
application of his whole life. Of all the great Italian
masters of violin-making Stradivari was always his
ideal, and by constant study, and cultivation of his
own rare natural powers of observation, he acquired
such an intimate knowledge and judgment of Stradivari’s
work in every detail, that he might almost be
said to be better acquainted with that maker’s instruments
than the master himself. Vuillaume soon found
the sale of violins, issued as new works, without any
semblance of antiquity, an unprofitable undertaking,
and, recognizing the growing demand in all parts of the
world for instruments resembling the great works of
Cremona, he determined to apply his great skill as a
workman, and his extraordinary familiarity with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Stradivari’s models, to the construction of faithful copies
of that great maker’s works. This was the foundation
of his success, for the modern copies found a ready
sale, and orders poured in upon Vuillaume from all parts
of the world. These instruments, imitations though
they were, had high intrinsic merit; and it is to be
remembered that they were copies made from unrivalled
models, with a fidelity and care such as only a devoted
worshipper and a great master of his art could attain.
He spared no pains in striving after perfection in the
quality of his materials, and he treated the obscure and
difficult problem of varnish (the secret of which, as
applied by the old Italian masters, seems to have died
with them) with a success which has probably not been
equalled by any other maker since their time. The
number of these instruments bearing his name is
enormous, upwards of two thousand five hundred being
known to exist; and many of them he made throughout
with his own hand. They were almost always numbered
inside, in the middle of the back, in pencil, and we have
it on the best authority that every instrument was
varnished by his own hand. In a letter written by
Vuillaume in 1875, a few weeks before his death, to
the well-known Parisian violin maker, M. Silvestre,
then living in Lyons, he says: “I have completed
three thousand instruments, all sold, paid for, and the
money spent, and it affords me great satisfaction.”</p>

<p class='c012'>To return to “Le Messie.” This wonderful instrument
remained in Vuillaume’s possession until his
death. He kept it for inspection in a glass case, and
never allowed it to be touched, even by the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>experienced hands, as we can personally testify. These
precautions gave rise to the rumour of its being a violin
of his own construction, and the statement written by
him inside the belly has, therefore, an additional interest
and importance. We have some interesting records of
the anxieties attendant upon such precious possessions,
in a correspondence which passed between Vuillaume
and Madame Alard (his daughter) at the time of the
Franco-German war. On the 30th of August, 1870,
he wrote—“In my last I spoke to you of Alard’s
Violin, of my ‘Messie,’ and of certain valuables which
I have here. I do not know what to do with them,
for, if one survives, one will be able to recover the
valuables when the hubbub is over, as some sous can
be buried; but violins cannot be buried.”</p>

<p class='c012'>In another letter he wrote—“I do not know
what to do with the precious things I have;
first, there are your violins—what ought I to
do with them? The boxes of plate, my medals,
and the ‘Messie’—where ought I to place all these
in case of pillage?”</p>

<p class='c012'>The medals referred to are no doubt those conferred
upon him in connection with the Paris Exhibitions of
1827, 1834, 1839, 1844, 1855, and the Great Exhibition
in England of 1851.</p>

<p class='c012'>Again he wrote on the 13th of September—“I am
going to hide your husband’s violins with the ‘Messie.’
I have found quite a safe hiding place protected from
fire—‘puis à la grâce de Dieu’!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Le Messie” happily escaped the dangers apprehended
by Vuillaume, and after his death (19th
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>March, 1875), in the absence of definite instructions
as to its disposal, it was inherited by his only
children, Jeanne Emilie and Claire Marie, in common.
The former was the wife of M. Alard, the violinist,
and the second daughter had married M. Mestayer,
in whose charge the violin was left, together with
other valuable instruments, during Vuillaume’s absence
from Paris in the terrible time of the Commune.
After his death the violin was valued for the estate at
£1,000, and in 1877 M. Alard bought out his sister-in-law’s
half-share for £500 and thus became, through
his wife, the entire owner. Vuillaume probably considered
it unnecessary during his lifetime to present
Alard with this violin, as he was already well provided
with instruments, and had the choice of some of the
finest that passed through Vuillaume’s hands. These
included the famous Stradivari known as the “Alard,”
the fine Giuseppe Guarnieri, dated 1742 (presented
after Alard’s death to the Paris Conservatoire), and
the Grand Nicolo Amati, dated 1645, now in the
possession of Baron Knoop.</p>

<p class='c012'>Delphin Alard was the most eminent representative
of the modern French school of violin playing. After
studying as a pupil of the Paris Conservatoire, he in
1843 succeeded Baillot as professor, and achieved
a great reputation both as performer and teacher,
and as the author of a violin school and editor of
classical compositions for that instrument. He
numbered among his pupils many who have since
distinguished themselves, and notably the celebrated
violinist Señor Sarasate. At Alard’s death, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>February 22, 1888, “Le Messie” came into the
possession of his widow and two daughters, Madame
Guesnet and Madame Croué—he, like Vuillaume,
having left no directions as to the disposal of his
instruments. On the death of Madame Alard, M.
Croué, on behalf of his wife and her sister, sold the
violin, on the 5th May, 1890, to us, on behalf of Mr.
R. Crawford, an enthusiastic amateur, of Trinity,
Edinburgh, for the sum of 50,000 francs (£2,000),
which is the largest authenticated amount ever paid
for a violin. It is interesting to compare these figures
with Mr. Charles Reade’s estimate of the value of the
instrument in 1872 at £600 (<i>see</i> “Readiana”).</p>

<p class='c012'>Having traced from authentic sources the unbroken
record of this famous violin, let us examine the characteristic
features of an instrument which has excited
the unqualified admiration and ambition of the first
makers and connoisseurs of Europe. The plates
which accompany this memoir have been admirably
executed by Mr. Shirley Slocombe, and reproduced by
chromo-lithography under the direction of Mr. Alfred
Slocombe; and they offer an accurate and beautiful
representation of the instrument.</p>

<p class='c012'>The striking originality of Stradivari’s work asserts
itself in nearly all his productions, there being hardly
an instrument of his which is not characterised
by some features peculiar to itself. The Salabue
violin has several unmistakable characteristics. The
most original and distinctive is the height and pronounced
sharpness of the wave-like ridge, bordering
the surfaces of the back and belly close to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>outline. In other instruments of the same maker
this <i>ridge</i> is much rounder in form. Let us further
illustrate the point. The purfling, which is sunk
in the wood at about one-eighth of an inch from
the outline, lies generally at the bottom of a hollow
which forms the lowest portion of the surface. In
our example the surface rises outwards from the
purfling in a concave curve to a greater height and
to a more sharply defined ridge than in any other
Stradivari instrument known to us. Another distinctive
feature is the form of the corners, which are cut more
square than any we have seen. Both these features are
accentuated by the absolute freshness of the instrument.
The sound holes are more slanting than is usual in
instruments of this period, although this was less
rare in those of earlier date. In fact, we have seen
no other Stradivari violin of the years 1715, 1716,
1717, or 1718 with sound holes similarly placed.</p>

<p class='c012'>The model of the violin is decidedly flat, especially in
the belly, but the genius of the master asserts itself in
the compensation he has provided in the height of the
sides.</p>

<p class='c012'>The wood leaves little to be desired. The back, in
two pieces, has a broad, handsomely marked curl, while
the pine of the belly has a fine silky grain, neither too
coarse nor too fine. The sides and head, as well as
the neck, which is original, are perhaps a little plain
in comparison with the back; but the great Italians
never troubled about matching the sides and head to
the back, as is the custom among modern makers. It
is not uncommon to meet with instruments with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>back cut in slab form, and the sides and head cut on
the quarter.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Charles Reade in some notes in “Readiana,”
from which we have already quoted, refers to what he
calls a crack in the violin. The mark which has given
rise to his statement is in reality one of three insignificant
and almost imperceptible shakes in the wood,
such as frequently appear during the seasoning
of the pine blocks used for bellies. These shakes are
easily glued and then become invisible; but are opened
again by exposure to the sun during the drying of the
varnish. They are, however, in no sense defects.</p>

<p class='c012'>The varnish is a study in itself, for it is untouched
and unrubbed, as if it had been laid on yesterday.
It has not perhaps the luscious richness of some
of Stradivari’s instruments, and it appears drier and
less thickly laid on than usual in violins of the same
period. This is especially noticeable on the sides,
where the grain of the wood rose as the varnish was
applied to it, and still stands up as on the day when
the brush left it. On the head again one can clearly see
where the varnish accumulated slightly as it flowed
round the volute. Such details as these could not be
traced but for the wonderful preservation of the varnish.</p>

<p class='c012'>The necessity of opening the instrument, in order
to insert a stronger bass bar, gave us an opportunity
of examining the inside, which is as
remarkable as the outside. This is only the second
occasion on which the violin has been opened in
the course of its existence. Vuillaume opened it,
and took the opportunity to write inside on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>belly the following inscription, which affords valuable
corroborative evidence of the authenticity of the
record already given.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id008'>
<a href='images/image024.jpg'><img src='images/image024.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'></a>
<div class='ic008'>
<p>“<i>achette par Tarisio au C<sup>te</sup> Cossio de Salabue<br>  an 1827 achette par Vuillaume le 12. Janr 1855</i><br>  <br>  <i>Le Messie</i>”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The bass bar which Vuillaume then fitted was not
strong enough, and allowed after a time a slight depression
of the belly, necessitating the renewal above referred
to. Excepting for the change of bar, everything inside
is as Stradivari left it. The blocks and linings, considered
in relation to the thicknesses, are a model of
consistency, neither heavy nor flimsy, made of the
lightest and toughest wood we know, and all finished
with the gouge and knife alone. Stradivari evidently
disdained the superficial finish given by modern copyists
to their interior work by the free use of glass paper.</p>

<p class='c012'>The thicknesses of belly and back, a point on which
Stradivari appears to have made numerous experiments,
are of his stoutest.</p>

<p class='c012'>The whiteness of the label, and the variance of the
instrument in some features from the characteristic
style of that period of Stradivari’s work, have given rise
on different occasions to the supposition that the label
was not genuine, and that the violin was of a later date;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>but the careful examination which we made of the
interior when the belly was removed, has enabled us to
finally dispose of this idea. The label has never been
moved since Stradivari fixed it in its place, nor have the
figures upon it been tampered with in any way.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c018'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>Details of construction, such as we have examined in
the preceding paragraphs, offered, to a man of Stradivari’s
great originality, scope for almost endless variety
of treatment, which has furnished us with a key to the
pronounced distinctions between his instruments and
others of the Italian school.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the Brescian instruments, for instance, there is, as
a general rule, no hollowing near the edges of the backs
and bellies, nor any <i>bordering ridge</i> like that discussed
above. They consequently have an appearance of
strength and solidity, but lack the style and elegance of
the Cremona school. The Amati family, on the other
hand, gifted with a keen sense of harmony and beauty of
form, gave perfect expression to these ideas in their
works; but, unfortunately, at some sacrifice of dignity of
appearance. Stradivari attained the happy mean
between these two extremes, and carried his ideas into
execution with such perfection of detail, that all his
successors have had to content themselves with the
<i>rôle</i> of copyists, and none have been found to improve
upon their model.</p>

<p class='c012'>There can be no doubt that the Salabue Violin has
exercised a strong influence upon modern copyists. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Turin maker, Pressenda (1777 to 1854), who was
acquainted with Count Salabue, and his pupil Rocca
(d. 1862), who knew Tarisio, were evidently familiar with
the instrument. Rocca in particular would seem to have
made it his ideal, for we find reproduced in nearly all
his copies of Stradivari the characteristic sharp <i>bordering
ridge</i>, slanting sound holes, and general flat model of
the Salabue. As soon as it came into Vuillaume’s
possession, he set to work to reproduce it in every
detail, and his copies of this instrument are unquestionably
the finest violins he made. They are true to the
original in bearing no traces of wear; but a few of them
are fitted with carved pegs and tailpiece similar to those
added by him and still attached to the Salabue. The
carving on the tailpiece represents the figure of the
Madonna with the infant Christ. Nearly all the other
Parisian and Mirecourt makers in turn have copied
Vuillaume, but without his advantages in ability, and in
having the original model to work from. The copies of
the present day are becoming in consequence more and
more ridiculous exaggerations of the peculiar features
of the Salabue.</p>

<p class='c012'>The year 1716 appears not to have been prolific of
great works from Stradivari, as we know at present of
only one fine violin of that year beside the Salabue.
This is the one known as the Cessol, belonging to Mr.
William Croall. The previous year, 1715, produced five
famous violins, two now belonging to Herr Joachim, one
to Señor Sarasate, one to G. Haddock, Esq., and another
known as the Alard. The year 1717 again produced
two notable instruments, a violin belonging to J. G.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Orchar, Esq., and the well-known violoncello for
many years the property of Bonamy Dobree, Esq.,
and now in the possession of E. I. Holden, Esq.</p>

<p class='c012'>For an appreciative description of the beauties
of the Salabue we may quote an enthusiast, the
Rev. H. R. Haweis, whose writings and lectures
upon his favourite study have made the name of
Stradivari familiar to thousands of the English-speaking
people. Mr. Haweis, referring to the exhibition of
the instrument in London, in 1872, wrote—“It is for
the first time unveiled in all its intact glory to the gaze
of thousands to whom for years it has been a kind of
myth. It is as though the ivory Minerva of Phidias,
that stood once in the Parthenon, should be discovered
hidden away with the utmost care in some deep dry
and hermetically-sealed sepulchre of the East, and
brought over scatheless to be set up amidst the Elgin
fragments. So stands this matchless new violin amidst
its time-worn, rubbed, and fractured brethren. It is of
the grand pattern; it is massive without looking
massive; its strength is hidden beneath its grace.
The back is in two parts; the wood very choice. The
fine graining of the flat belly is remarkable. The holes
are delicately cut, the left <a id='tn027'></a><span class='large'><i><b>f</b></i></span> a shade lower than the
right; a practice so common that it must have been
intentional with Stradivarius, his fine eye not tolerating
even there a suspicion of mechanical work. We see in
this violin what the perfect Stradivari corners were.
In almost every other known specimen the corners and
the wood are both rubbed. In Le Messie they are
untouched and clean-looking; wondrously sharp and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>wide awake, yet without vulgarity, and of a perfect
finish. The ease and neatness of the purfling is incomparable,
and over the whole instrument lies a thick
rich red brown varnish wondrous to behold; the
washing of it is level and lavish, and unworn by time or
use. The brush seems to have left it about a week.
The neck has been lengthened by M. Vuillaume. The
head is light and graceful rather than heavy or powerful,
the scroll thrown off like a ribbon lightly curled
round the finger and drawn in; one side of the scroll
is slightly lower than the other, the fluting smooth,
with a surface like that of clear still water, and the
lines of the scroll picked out with a thick rim of
black varnish that serves to accentuate the outlines
of the head, just as purfling calls attention to the
contour of the back and belly. In nearly every other
violin this black head-rim has been almost entirely
effaced, but in Le Messie it remains to show us the
maker’s intention. He meant you to take up his
violin and see at a glance its whole outline traced and
emphasized by a sharp purfling carried out in the head
by a deep rim of black varnish. This brooding over the
beauty of curves, this anxiety that they should be manifest
to all men is most instructive and touching; neither the
purfling nor the black varnish added to the tone, nor
even the preservation of the instrument—it was the art
instinct of the old makers piercing the manufacture.”</p>

<p class='c012'>That ardent student and devotee of the violin, Mr.
Charles Reade, has made some suggestive remarks
upon the method of varnishing which he supposed
Stradivari to have pursued; and, as Mr. Reade makes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>reference to the Salabue, his words may prove of interest
in the present connection. He preferred to describe
the violin as the Vuillaume Strad, and while agreeing
with his objection to the name which has clung to it,
we regret that the title conferred upon it by Tarisio,
the “Salabue,” has not been retained. That name
has the merit of historical distinctiveness, and would
create a most desirable precedent in violin nomenclature,
as a set off to the absurd and confusing
nicknames which have become so common. There are
no less than three “Jupiter Strads”; one “Emperor
Strad”; two “King” Josephs (Guarnieri); and another
of the same maker called “Le Diable.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Reade begins with some general suggestions
as to the great maker’s method, and says: “He
began with three or four coats of oil varnish containing
some common gum. He then laid on several coats
of red varnish made by simply dissolving some fine
red unadulterated gum in spirit; the spirit evaporated
and left pure gum lying in a rich oil varnish from
which it chips by its dry nature and its utter want
of chemical affinity to the substratum.... The
Vuillaume Strad, not being worn, does not assist us
in this particular line of argument; but it does not
contradict us. Indeed there are a few little chips in the
top varnish of the back, and they reveal a heterogeneous
varnish below, with its rich yellow colour like the bottom
varnish of the Pawle bass. Moreover, if you look at
the top varnish closely you shall see what you never
see in a new violin of our day; not a vulgar glare upon
the surface, but a gentle inward fire. Now that inward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>fire, I assure you, is mainly caused by the oil varnish
below; the orange varnish above has a heterogeneous
foil below. That inward glow is characteristic of all
foils. If you could see the Vuillaume Stradivarius at
night, and move it about in the light of a candle, you
would be amazed at the fire of the foil and the refraction
of light....</p>

<p class='c012'>“A violin varnished as I have indicated will look a
little better than other new violins from the first; the
back will look nearly as well as the Vuillaume Stradivarius,
but not quite. The belly will look a little better
if properly prepared; will show the fibre of the deal
better....</p>

<p class='c012'>“... Sand-paper is a great enemy to varnish;
it drives more wood-dust into the pores than you can
blow out.... The back of the Vuillaume
Stradivarius, which is the finest part, has clearly not
been sand-papered in places, so probably not at all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>With regard to the tone of the instrument, some
comments written in 1864 by the well-known authority,
F. J. Fetis, are worthy of repetition. He writes of the
Salabue Stradivari: “This genuine memorial of ancient
manufacture—this instrument which has not resounded
under the bow for nearly a century and a half—gives
striking refutation to the idea that a free and pure tone
cannot be produced from a violin until after it has been
long in use; for here, in this new instrument, we find
in combination all the qualities of power, mellowness,
roundness, delicacy, freedom, with a noble and penetrating
tone. In a word, this violin is a type of external
beauty and of sonorous perfection.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Nevertheless it is our opinion after a careful trial
that the instrument would be greatly improved in tone
by further use.</p>

<p class='c012'>These descriptions of one of the finest instruments in
existence, from the hands of devoted and disinterested
lovers of the Cremona handiwork, leave hardly anything
to be added except the exact measurements of the violin,
which are as follows:—</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>This account coincides almost word for word with a notice of the
instrument by F. J. Fetis quoted in part on p. 30 of this work.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c012'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>The article on Stradivari in Grove’s Dictionary of Music assigns
eighty-eight as the maker’s age at his death, but the evidence of Count
Salabue, quoted at p. 12, confirmed by further evidence lately obtained
from authentic instruments of this maker, point to the conclusion
that he lived certainly to 1737, when he had entered his ninety-fourth
year. This conclusion refers his birth to the year 1644, which would
accord more naturally with the events of his life than the later date
suggested in Grove. This question will be treated more fully in a future
publication.</p>
